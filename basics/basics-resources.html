        You don’t need to figure everything out alone. There’s a wealth of free (and paid) content out there to help you build your financial knowledge—from books and podcasts to YouTube creators and forums.
      </p>

      <p>
        Start with the basics: books like *The Psychology of Money*, podcasts like *ChooseFI*, or websites like NerdWallet and Investopedia. These break down complex ideas into digestible tips for real life.
      </p>

      <p>
        YouTube channels like Graham Stephan, Our Rich Journey, and The Plain Bagel are also great entry points. Just make sure you're not blindly following hype—look for creators who emphasize education over entertainment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most importantly, don’t just consume—reflect and apply. As you grow your toolkit, you’ll get sharper at filtering advice and shaping your own financial playbook.
