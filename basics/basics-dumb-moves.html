  <h2>The Dumbest Things You Could Do With Your Money</h2>
  <p data-editable>Buying liabilities you can’t afford. Living paycheck to paycheck by choice. Ignoring your future self.</p>
  <p data-editable> I would argue that for every good financial move you can make, there are at least 10 bad ones. There are so many bad ideas out there that I think if I where
    to list them all, I would need a book. My goal is to borderline traumatize you some of the horrors wallstreet has to offer in hopes that you don't put yourself
    in a position that would burn your money. I promise you, if you really don't know what you're doing all it takes is a couple of button clicks to get yourself in some complex and risky position and it would be
    <strong>much</strong>
    harder to try and put gasoline on a pile of money and burning it than it would be to just click a few buttons and lose it all.
    
    Here are some horrendously bad ideas that should be avoided like the plague ranked subjectively from <strong>BAD</strong> to <strong>WORST</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
        
      <li>Not paying off your credit cards each month</li>
        
      <li>Utilizing leverage without any understanding or safe guards in place</li>
        
      <li>Investing in a financial instrument without having a single clue of the underlying asset</li>
        
      <li>Jumping into debt without recognizing a plan to payoff the debt</li>
    </ul>
