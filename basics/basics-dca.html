      <p>
        Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) is a strategy where you invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the asset. Instead of trying to time the market, you focus on building your position over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This helps reduce the emotional pressure of buying at the "perfect" time and allows you to take advantage of both market highs and dips. Over time, your average cost per share tends to balance out, and you benefit from steady market participation.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's especially useful for long-term investors who want to stay disciplined without constantly watching the market.
