        Your money decisions should align with your goals—not your emotions, not your friends, and definitely not random internet flexes. Whether you’re saving for a car, a house, or that dream trip, clarity matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being objective means knowing what you want and mapping out a path to get there. That might include budgeting, automating savings, or saying no to purchases that don’t serve your plan.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don’t need to be perfect—you just need to be intentional. When you give your money a job, it stops getting wasted. And when you track progress, you stay motivated without the guilt spiral.
