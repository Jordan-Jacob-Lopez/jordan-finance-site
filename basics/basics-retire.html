    <h1 id="page-title">Thoughts on Retirement</h1>
    <p class="subtitle" id="page-subtitle">Retirement isn’t just about age—it’s about freedom, time, and choice.</p>

    <div id="page-content">
      <p>
        Retirement doesn’t have to mean sitting on a beach at 65. It can simply mean having the freedom to walk away from work if and when you choose—without money being the reason you’re stuck.
      </p>

      <p>
        The earlier you start thinking about retirement, the more control you’ll have over your future. Even small contributions to a 401(k), Roth IRA, or HSA can snowball into meaningful wealth over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether your goal is traditional retirement, financial independence, or just peace of mind, the key is to start with intention. Know your “why,” understand your options, and take consistent action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Retirement isn’t one-size-fits-all. But having a plan for it—even if it changes—is one of the smartest financial moves you can make.
