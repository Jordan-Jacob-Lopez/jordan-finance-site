    <h2>Markets Are Insane, Don't Be Stupid</h2>
    <p data-editable>Markets move fast. Stay patient. Avoid FOMO. Zoom out. Think long-term.</p>
    <p data-editable>Pretty self explanatory... Stick to some basic ideas and not only will you be saving money, but you will also be passively receiving interest.
      We live in an age where its never been easier to access various ways to save and invest your money. The problem is we also live in an age where its so easy to 
      spend money and lose it. There are so many options out there that it can be overwhelming, and the financial industry doesn't make it any easier.
