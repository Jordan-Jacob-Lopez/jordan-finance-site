      <p>
        Inflation refers to the rising cost of goods and services over time. While a little inflation is normal, high inflation can dramatically reduce what your money can buy—especially if your income doesn’t rise with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, $100 today won’t buy you the same groceries, gas, or rent a decade from now. That’s inflation at work. If your savings aren’t growing faster than inflation, you're essentially losing money in slow motion.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why investing matters. By putting your money to work in assets that outpace inflation—like stocks, real estate, or tax-advantaged accounts—you protect your future purchasing power and financial freedom.
