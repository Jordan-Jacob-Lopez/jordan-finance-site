      <p>
        Investing based on emotion—fear, greed, excitement, panic—can seriously derail your long-term financial goals. Emotional decisions often lead to buying high when the hype is strong and selling low when fear kicks in.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s human nature to react to volatility, but good investors learn to zoom out and stay grounded. Markets fluctuate. Headlines can be scary. But jumping in and out of investments rarely works out well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Instead, build a plan and stick to it. Whether you're investing monthly, quarterly, or with bonuses, consistency beats drama. Emotions aren’t bad—but letting them drive your money decisions usually is.
