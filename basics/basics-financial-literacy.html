        <h2>What is Financial Literacy?</h2>
        <p data-editable>Financial literacy is understanding how to manage your money — budgeting, saving, investing, and avoiding debt traps. It’s what lets you make smart, confident decisions with your cash.</p>

          Its important every person has some sort of financial literacy. You don't need to spend days deep diving into complex research, but you
          also can't afford to be making thousands of dollars per year and have no clue what is happening with your money.
          Like any subject, everyone has their own interests into how far they're willing to go into a subject. Without going into too much details,
          the next sections should share some details of some fairly important financial topics that I think would be the first things anyone should know
          about their money.
