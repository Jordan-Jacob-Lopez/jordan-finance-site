                Its important every person has some sort of financial literacy. You don't need to spend days deep diving into complex research, but you
                also can't afford to be making thousands of dollars per year and have no clue what is happening with your money.
                Like any subject, everyone has their own interests into how far they're willing to go into a subject. Without going into too much details,
                the next sections should share some details of some fairly important financial topics that I think would be the first things anyone should know
                about their money.

          <h2>The Dumbest Sh*t You Could Do With Your Money</h2>
          <p>Financial literacy is your ability to understand and use money-related skills like budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. Think of it as your personal toolkit for making smarter decisions with your money—now and long term.</p>

          <h2>Why Making Money Early Actually Matters</h2>
          <p>
            When people talk about "making your money work for you" this is what they mean. The earlier you start saving and investing, the more time compound interest has to do its thing — and that can seriously change your life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s say you’ve built up a $1 million investment portfolio that earns around 6% annually. That’s $60,000 a year in growth alone — without you doing anything. If you're living simply, that could fully cover your lifestyle. Even if not, that’s serious financial cushion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, getting to $1 million might sound wild — but let’s break it down:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you make $100,000 a year and manage to save $20,000 of it annually…</li>
            <li>And you consistently invest that $20,000 into a portfolio earning 6%…</li>
            <li>You’ll hit $1 million in about 25 years.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            That’s not a lottery win — that’s just steady saving, smart investing, and time. Start in your 20s and you could reach that goal before 50. Start in your 30s and you're still set up for a powerful financial future. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Making money early matters not because you need to be rich by 30 — but because time is your greatest asset, and money made young has the most time to grow.
