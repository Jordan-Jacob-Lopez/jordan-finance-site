            Hey, I’m Jordan. I’m a product manager and former systems engineer who became obsessed with personal finance and the idea of early retirement. I enjoy learning about
              financial "stuff" and sharing what I learn with others. I remember when I graduated college and was so eager to begin having a paycheck and not needing
               to nickel and dime my week on fast food and relatively cheap drinks. With that excitement I quickly became overwhelmed with the idea of managing my finances. I 
               had no clue of things like standard of living, impportance of saving, and ultimately what my version of financial freedom would look like. I hope this site
               can serve as a resource for my friends who are in a similar boat as I once was or for anyone who is looking to learn more about financial literacy.
